**Description**

Multiple Organisational Units (OUs) were identified with no child objects. While this is not a direct security vulnerability, unused or legacy OUs can retain delegated permissions and/or GPO links, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and administrative error. Removing unneeded OUs reduces directory complexity and limits residual permission paths.

**Remediation**

Consult the list below of empty OUs and remove any that are no longer required.
