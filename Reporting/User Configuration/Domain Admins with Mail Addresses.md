**Description**

A number of administrative accounts within the domain were found to have an email address configured. While this is not inherently a vulnerability, modern best practices recommend that highly privileged accounts should not be used for general internet or email activities. Accounts with elevated privileges that are exposed to email or web-based interactions are at increased risk of compromise through phishing or other web-based attacks, which could lead to significant impact on domain security.

**Remediation**

Review the listed accounts and, where possible, restrict email and internet-based activities for these accounts to reduce their exposure. Limiting such access for highly privileged accounts helps minimise the risk of compromise through phishing or web-based attacks.
