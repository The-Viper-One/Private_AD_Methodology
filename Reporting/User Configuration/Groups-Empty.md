**Description**

Several groups within the Active Directory environment were identified as having no members. While this is not inherently a vulnerability, it is recommended to remove unused groups to help reduce the overall attack surface of the domain. If any of these groups are assigned special privileges, a future account added to them could introduce unnecessary risk, as a compromised member could be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the domain.

**Remediation**

Review the listed groups below and delete any that are no longer required.
